            <section class="cookware">
                <h4>Shattering cookware</h4>
                <p>More than 37,000 people were injured from using cookware. Hot handles can burn and sometimes glass
                    cookware can shatter.</p>

                <h4>Microwave oven burns</h4>
                <p>More than 10,000 people were hurt using microwaves. Burns were most common.</p>

                <h4>Knife cuts</h4>
                <p>Lacerations caused by knives of all kinds (not just the kitchen type) affected more than 350,000
                    people
                    in 2012, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Dull knives are actually more
                    dangerous
                    than sharp ones, because they require more pressure to use and their worn edge can cause the knife
                    to
                    slip off food and into your fingers.</p>

                <h4>Cooking fires</h4>
                <p>Fires involving cooking equipment account for two of every five reported home fires. Unattended
                    cooking
                    equipment accounts for one in three fires, and half are ignited by fat, grease, oil, or related
                    substances, according to the National Fire Protection Association.

                <h4>Contact Burns From Equipment</h4>
                <p>The oven is magic. No longer do we have to sear our food on an open fire like our ancestors did; we
                    have
                    a nifty box that keeps the heat contained and cooks our food to perfection. But all that heat
                    combined
                    with metal components and cookware leads to loads of burns. Quick tips (which are obvious, but good
                    to
                    keep in mind): Always use oven mitts, replace them when they’re old; don’t use a wet towel as an
                    oven
                    mitt; don’t reach your arm in to check baked goods, pull out the rack to test;

                <h4>Death to the Pathogens
                </h4>
                <p>The most insidious of all dangers, perhaps, are the germs lurking in your food. The Centers for
                    Disease
                    Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that each year roughly one in six Americans (or 48 million
                    people) gets sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases. The top five
                    culprits
                    sending Americans to the hospital are salmonella, norovirus, Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma gondii
                    and
                    E.coli – but much can be done in terms of proper food handling, cooking and storage to help prevent
                    these pathogens from causing illness.</p>
